## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Add from library" not showing

**Solution:**
- The uploaded AAB should appear in the release creation page automatically
- If not, try uploading the AAB again directly in the release creation page
- Make sure you're in the correct track (Production/Testing)

### Issue: Version already in use

**Solution:**
- If version 12 is already used elsewhere, you may need to:
  - Remove it from other tracks first, OR
  - Increment version code and rebuild

### Issue: Can't find the AAB

**Solution:**
- Go back to "All app bundles" page
- Verify version 12 is there
- Click on it to see details
- Then go back to Production and create release
